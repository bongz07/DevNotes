## What is HTML

**<head></head>** element is not visible on the website, it is visible as the name of the browser in a tab.
What matters for us is what you put into the body <body></body>

<span> element is when you donâ€™t want to start a new paragraph or a new line

You cannot place one paragraph inside of another paragraph, which is element <p>

The element <p> cannot be placed inside element <ul>, but only on element <li>

An attribute is the property of the element. href= is an attribute

Use the <aside> element to put it into a box

Input is a self closing element

Dont put a <div> element inside a paragraph element <p>. Place the <div> after the <p> element.
