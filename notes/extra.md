# Browser info

A browser sends a request to the server where this page is hosted on the internet.
When the server receives the requests it will take all the files that make up all the website and send them back to the browser, the server sends a response to the browser.

So once the browser receives these html, css, and javascript files from the servers response, it will take the code and render the website based on that code. Browsers will produce a visual output based on the code we write as developers. This is called the front end of a website (code that is written by developers that is displayed on the browser. .

The backend contains an application that runs on a server along with a database that contains all the data necessary to power the backend.
